> <a href="https://wavetimer.junyoung.dev">Wavetimer</a> is Web Project based on React.js. In this project, I implemented water ripple effect using wave equation. Also, the background wave is connected to the timer so you can check time left directly by the amount of the water. I implemented below function in this project.
